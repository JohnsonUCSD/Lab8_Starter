## Question 
Graceful degradation and service workers are related because try to keep the app working when there is something happening that is preventing that. Service workers make the app still work when there is network issues or no network, and graceful degradation allows websites to have limited functionality when some features are not working or not supported. Service worker will try to keep the working such as caching and loading an image when there is no network, but if the service worker can't, then graceful degradation occurs and a simpler version is loaded.
